# MATTE (ManÃ­pulus AttestatiÃ³num / Sheaf of Testimonies)

> Builds multilingual parallel scripture passages

A tool that allows for creating side-by-side scripture citations in two or three languages (Latin/English/French/Etc.). And also having configurable options for visuals and styling.

The target use case is for producing multilingual parallel scripture passages. If this is a repetitive task for someone, then this tool could save time for studying, teaching, and parochial usage.
